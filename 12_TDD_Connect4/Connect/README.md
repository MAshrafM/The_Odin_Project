<h1>The Odin Project</h1>
<h2>Project: Testing Ruby with RSpec</h2>
<h3>Project: TDD Connect Four</h3>
<p>Building Connect Four TDD-style... many rspec in the spec folder</p>
<p>Game is fairly easy but challenging in assessing diagonals and dispalying grid properly</p>
<p>Future again maybe adding AI to play computer and Graphics</p>
<p>Windows Unicode -_- so X and O as tokens :/ </p>
