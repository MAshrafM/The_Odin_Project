# The Odin Project
##Project: Building and Using APIs

- Project_1 : Odin Kittens

This is a fast and straightforward project where you'll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API... which is just a fancy way of saying that all your controller methods will render data instead of HTML.

This project may seem simple, but now you've got a website that is both a normal HTML-producing back end AND an API that can be used to pull data from it. You could use Javascript calls from the front end to dynamically refresh your data now or even to load the whole page in the first place. Or maybe you'll be hooking up a Kittens app to your iPhone and need a back end. It doesn't matter, since now you've got a RESTful API.
