<h3><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms">Project#11.1 : Searching Binary Trees</a></h3>
<p>Task: </p>
<ul>
<li>Build a class Node. It should have a value that it stores and also links to its parent and children</li>
<li>Write a method build_tree which takes an array of data (e.g. [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.</li>
<li>Build a method breadth_first_search which takes a target value and returns the node at which it is located using the breadth first search technique</li>
<li>Build a method depth_first_search which returns the node at which the target value is located using the depth first search technique. Use an array acting as a stack to do this</li>
<li>Next, build a new method dfs_rec which runs a depth first search as before but this time, instead of using a stack, make this method recursive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Project as a ruby gem like before, with tests in RSpec in spec folders.</p>
<p>Tree is different if the array is sorted, than shuffled</p>
<p>Future expand to do something useful maybe that's in the second part of this project with Knight</p>
