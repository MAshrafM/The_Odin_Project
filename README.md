<p>"The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources.
Not everyone has access to a computer science education 
or the funds to attend an intensive coding school 
and neither of those is right for everyone anyway.
This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own 
but still want a high quality education."</p>
<p>
This is going to be a long journey... taking it a step at a time.<br />
And this will be the collection of <strong>projects</strong> through it all.
