<p>"The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively."</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.</li>
<li>Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.</li>
</ol>
